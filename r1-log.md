## Log

### R1D1 
Rebased https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/5520 , tried to come up with better way to handle signal debugging in https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/5433 ultimatelly failing and finally started to update https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/5124 - this will use slpashscreen IMO

### R1D2

Worked on https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/5124 for little over an hour and I think I'm defeated. I haven't found a way to show little window on closing.

### R1D3

Worked on https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/5124 - due to unforseen issues and complexity it seems that hiding main window early is the best way for now. For splashscreen opened up https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/5782
After some perl fun created PR https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/5786

### R1D4

Rebased https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/4360 and changed "user modified" icon to pen. Need help with UI/UX side of things.
